# My resume

My name is Egor Kichuk. 
And I assume that no one will see this text. If you are reading this text, then I am close to working at EPAM (hopefully). Today is 29.10.2020.
I want to say a few words abaut myself. Now I have a goal - to became front-end devoloper. Today I dealt
with GitHub branches for an hour. Thanks to my friend, this lesson did not take all day.
My best character trait is the ability to get along in a team. I'm also purposeful and cute :)
I have such skills as writing "Hello world!" in HTML, Java, Python and JS.
*Thank you for attention.*
